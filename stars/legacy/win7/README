REQUIREMENTS
	Python 2.3 or greater (with Tkinter)
	http://www.python.org

	Numeric (a.k.a. Numpy) 23.1 or greater
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy 


INSTALLATION OF SOURCE DISTRIBUTIONS
Unpack the archive into a working directory. Currently all code
is to be run from this directory. Future releases will be set up
as modules to add to the site-packages directory of a Python
installation.

UNIX/LINUX
Assuming you unpacked to:

	/home/user/stars

    	cd /home/usr/stars
	
    	python starsgui.py

and you should be good to go.


OS X NOTES
STARS can run under X11 with Fink python, as well as Aqua. For the latter you
need to have MacPython (http://homepages.cwi.nl/~jack/macpython/) setup
with Aqua-Tk and Numeric. Instructions for installing these are can be found
at the macpython site.


How you start STARS on a mac depends on which version of python you are running under.
If you want to run STARS under X11 and Fink python, use the same instructions
as for UNIX/LINUX, just be sure your python points to Fink python, not the
default Apple python (which lacks Numpy and Tk).

If you want to run STARS using macpython, use:

    cd /Users/usr/stars
    pythonw starsgui.py

where pythonw points to the macpython installed version.



WINDOWS NOTES
Assuming you unpacked the source to:
    C:\stars
then:
    c:\python23\python starsgui.py

should get you going.

Important: Do not put STARS in a location that results in a path name with
whitespace (i.e., avoid putting it in c:\Program Files\stars).
